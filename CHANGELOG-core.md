# Changelog Chainlink Core

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.8.5] - 2020-06-01

### Added

- The chainlink node can now be configured to backfill logs from `n` blocks after a
  connection to the ethereum client is reset. This value is specified with an environment
  variable `BLOCK_BACKFILL_DEPTH`.
- The chainlink node now sets file permissions on sensitive files on startup (tls, .api, .env, .password and secret)
- AggregatorInterface now has description and version fields.

### Changed

- Solidity: Renamed the previous `AggregatorInterface.sol` to
  `HistoricAggregatorInterface.sol`. Users are encouraged to use the new methods
  introduced on the `AggregatorInterface`(`getRoundData` and `latestRoundData`),
  as they return metadata to indicate freshness of the data in a single
  cross-contract call.
- Solidity: Marked `HistoricAggregatorInterface` methods (`latestAnswer`,
  `latestRound`, `latestTimestamp`, `getAnswer`, `getTimestamp`) as deprecated
  on `FluxAggregator`, `WhitelistedAggregator`, `AggregatorProxy`,
  `WhitelistedAggregatorProxy`.
- Updated the solidity compiler version for v0.6 from 0.6.2 to 0.6.6.
- AccessControlledAggregatorProxy checks an external contract for users to be able to
  read functions.

### Fixed

- Fluxmonitor jobs now respect the `minPayment` field on job specs and won't poll if the contract
  does not have sufficient funding. This allows certain jobs to require a larger payment
  than `MINIMUM_CONTRACT_PAYMENT`.

## [0.8.4] - 2020-05-18

### Added

- Fluxmonitor initiators may now optionally include an `absoluteThreshold`
  parameter. To trigger a new on-chain report, the absolute difference in the feed
  value must change by at least the `absoluteThreshold` value. If it is
  unspecified or zero, fluxmonitor behavior is unchanged.
- Database Migrations: Add created_at and updated_at to all tables allowing for
  better historical insights. This migration may take a minute or two on large
  databases.

### Fixed

- Fix incorrect permissions on some files written by the node
  Prevent a case where duplicate ethereum keys could be added
  Improve robustness and reliability of ethtx transaction logic

## [0.8.3] - 2020-05-04

### Added

- Added Changelog.
- Database Migrations: There a number of database migrations included in this
  release as part of our ongoing effort to make the node even more reliable and
  stable, and build a firm foundation for future development.

### Changed

- New cron strings MUST now include time zone. If you want your jobs to run in
  UTC for example: `CRON_TZ=UTC * * * * *`. Previously, jobs specified without a
  time zone would run in the server's native time zone, which in most cases is UTC
  but this was never guaranteed.

### Fixed

- Fix crash in experimental gas updater when run on Kovan network
